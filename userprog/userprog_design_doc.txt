strtok_r() is a reentrant version of strtok(). You can call this from multiple threads simultaneously or in nested loops. strtok_r() takes an extra argument and uses this argument to store the state to an externally specified location between calls rather than using a global variable. strtok() saves the pointer in an internal static variable. This is unsafe because you are probably invoking an undefined behavior. Another process can race this variable at the same time.

In <thread.h>:

    #define EXIT_STATUS_INVALID 0xbadbadba   // Invalid exit status

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.

>> single process?

For each thread, there is a list of files that have been opened. 
File descriptors are unique within a single process. Since file descriptors are like an index number, different processes can use the same file descriptor while pointing to different files.


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

During syscalls, the user program passes its data to the kernel using pointers. Before dereferencing the pointer, we check the validity of the address by invoking the check_address() function. If the pointer is invalid, the process is killed by invoking sysexit(-1). This allows for accessing memory directly without issues of invalid address.

>> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call

First, we find the thread using the tid that is passed in. If the thread was not able to be found (TID is invalid), or the thread is in the dying state, or the exit status is EXIT_STATUS_INVALID, we set the exit status to EXIT_STATUS_INVALID and return -1 because something went wrong. 
If the exit status is not EXIT_STATUS_DEFAULT or EXIT_STATUS_INVALID, we set exit status to EXIT_STATUS_INVALID and return the original exit status of the thread. 
We then call the sema_down on the thread's semaphore, and if the thread's status is THREAD_BLOCKED, we unblock the thread. Then we set exit status of the thread to EXIT_STATUS_INVALID and return the original exit status of the thread.
The reason for changing the EXIT_STATUS_INVALID is because each child process can be waited on only once.

In order to protect against an invalid user-specified address, the function check_address() is called for each argument for each system call to make sure that the pointer is a virtual address, which tests to make sure the pointer is less than PHYS_BASE, so it is not a kernel pointer. If it is, we exit the process.
For each system call that takes a pointer argument, such as a buffer or char*, the pointer is validated in the same manner as above. These arguments are also passed with size to check the pointer to the end of the buffer or char* to ensure that that pointer is also valid.
An example of this is the sys_read system call. First, the syscall_handler identifies that the syscall is a write syscall. It then checks the address on the esp pointer of the interrupt frame. The arguments structure for the write syscall function are populated after validating the three addresses above the esp pointer by calling check_address on each. After this, the write syscall is invoked with the validated arguments. The pointer to the buffer pointer is then dereferenced and validated in the manner described above.

 
---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
>> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
>> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
>> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

When exec is called, after thread_create is called, the current process will wait until the child process finishes loading. If the child process successfully loads, it will open the executable in the file system and will prevent writing to the file, then will sema_up its semaphore. If it fails, it will set its exit_status to -1 and then will sema_up its semaphore. 
The parent process will then check the exit_status of the child process. If it is -1, it will return TID_ERROR (-1).


>> B8: Consider parent process P with child process C.  How do you

>> calls wait(C) before C exits?  After C exits?  How do you ensure
>> that all resources are freed in each case?  How about when P
>> terminates without waiting, before C exits?  After C exits?  Are

When P calls wait(C) before C exits, it will sema_down C's semaphore. C will only sema_up its semaphore when it exits. Since each child has its own semaphore and each child only has one parent, race conditions are avoided. 
When P calls wait(C) after C exits, since C already sema_up its semaphore when it exited, P will not wait on this when P calls sema_down on the semaphore. There are no race conditions in this case because there is only one live process accessing the semaphore. 
P always exits after C. Therefore, when C exits, it will not free its own exit_status because P might look at it later. When P exits, it will free the exit_status of C. P will also free its own exit status if its parent has exited. 
When P terminates without waiting before C exits, C's parent pointer will be nulled out and P's list of child_processes is freed, along with all of its other allocated data. 
When P terminates without waiting after C exits, P's data will be freed.
If C terminates because of an exception, the child_process list will be updated for C in P.


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

The validation for the user_esp pointer is checked before each system call within the syscall_handler. This is because each case can have the same address validation before invoking the syscall function that is to be invoked. Making sure that the address is not a kernel address and is instead a virtual address allows to make sure that it is a valid address for us to access.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?

Advantages: Regardless of whether the file descriptors are created by pipe or open, the same structure can store the information and can be used in the same way. Because each thread has its own list of files, there is no limit on the number of open file descriptors until there is no memory left.
Disadvantages: Accessing a file by file descriptor within the list takes time of O(n). Many duplicate file descriptor structs also exist since each thread has structs for these file descriptors. 


>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

This was not changed in our implementation.
